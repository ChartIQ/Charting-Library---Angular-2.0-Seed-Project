# Charting-Library---Angular-2.0-Seed-Project

A basic build of the ChartIQ library within the Angular 2.0 framework. This provides an example of how to implement the most common elements in the charting library. This is not a comprehensive example, more like a good starting point for an Angular developer.

## Requirements

A copy of the ChartIQ library. To get your copy, visit https://www.chartiq.com/products/html5-charting-library/ to see a demo and get in touch with us.

## Getting started

Create two symbolic links to the ChartIQ library js and css folders within a chartiq_library directory. The new file structure addition should be "chartiq_library/js" and "chartiq_library/css"

```npm intstall```

```npm start```

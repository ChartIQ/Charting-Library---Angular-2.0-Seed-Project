A basic build of the ChartIQ library within the Angular 6.0 framework. This provides an example of how to implement the most common elements in the charting library. This is not a comprehensive example, more like a good starting point for an Angular developer. [Here is a live demo of the Angular Seed Project.](https://demo.chartiq.com/angular-seed/)
